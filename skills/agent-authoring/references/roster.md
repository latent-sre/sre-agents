# Roster altitude — design the agent system, not one artifact

## First question: should this be multi-agent at all?

A single agent with good tools beats a committee for most tasks. Reach for multiple agents when: the
work exceeds one context window; stages need isolation (research vs execution, finder vs verifier);
independent perspectives reduce error (review panels, adversarial verification); or parallelism buys
real wall-clock time. If none of those hold, recommend the single-agent design and say why.

Multi-agent is an architecture decision with real costs — tokens, latency, and information loss at
every handoff — justified only when one context genuinely can't hold the work, stages need isolation,
independent perspectives reduce error, or parallelism pays. Fan-out runs **~15× the tokens of a normal
chat** (single agents already run ~4×), so default to fewer agents with better skills.

## Agent vs. skill (this fleet's decision rule)

An **agent** exists when it needs a **distinct tool-scope**. A distinct guard posture or recurring domain lane justifies a new agent only when it produces genuinely distinct tool authority. Everything else — altitude, method, checklist, playbook — is a **skill**. Seniority tiers are ladder skills, not cloned agents;
routing and live coordination stay in the main session because a coordinator subagent only adds a
round-trip for a low-context decision the main session can make inline. Apply this test before adding
any agent, and record the justification in the agent's own file (or an ADR if it reshapes the roster).

## Orchestration shapes

- **Orchestrator–workers** — the main session owns plan + synthesis; workers get bounded mandates
  and isolated context. This is the fleet default.
- **Pipeline** — items flow through stages independently, no barrier; wall-clock = slowest
  single-item chain. Default for multi-stage work.
- **Fan-out with barrier** — only when a stage needs ALL prior results at once (dedupe,
  cross-compare, early-exit on zero). Barriers idle the fast workers; justify each one.
- **Judge panel / adversarial verification** — independent attempts scored, or findings that
  survive only if skeptics prompted to *refute* them fail. Kills plausible-but-wrong output;
  worth the cost on high-stakes review.
- **Loop-until-dry** — for unknown-size discovery, iterate until K consecutive rounds surface
  nothing new; fixed counts miss the tail.

## Design principles

- **Workers are stateless and context-blind.** Construct exactly the context each needs: intent, current state, success criteria, exact inputs, source trust, open unknowns, and a return schema.
  Never assume workers inherit the caller's context. Underspecified handoffs are the #1 multi-agent bug.
- **The final message is the interface.** Specify each agent's return contract; free-text handoffs
  drop constraints at every hop. Preserve [verified], [sourced], [unverified], and [UNTRUSTED] labels.
- **Tools are authority.** The canonical tool list encodes the mandate. Enforce roles at the runtime
  layer, not with prose.
- **Descriptions route; keep them trigger-only** (see [artifact guidance](./artifact.md)).
- **Budget explicitly.** Tokens, latency, and strand count per task; right-size the fan-out: 1 agent
  for a lookup, 2–4 for a comparison or multi-lens review, more only for genuinely decomposable work.
- **Design the failure path.** Decide up front what happens when a worker returns garbage, nothing,
  or half the contract — and where untrusted content could enter.

## Failure modes to diagnose

Context poisoning (bad early output contaminates downstream) · telephone-game loss (each
summarization hop drops a constraint) · duplicated/overlapping work from vague lane boundaries ·
ambiguity amplification (one underspecified task fanned to N agents → N interpretations) · barrier
waste · runaway loops with no dry-out condition · missing return contracts.

## Deliverable

A roster delta or design: each agent's lane, trigger description, tool authority, handoff edges,
context budget, and failure handling. Agents inherit the session's model — don't add a model pin
unless one agent genuinely needs a different tier. Hand single-artifact wording to
[artifact guidance](./artifact.md), approved implementation to the typed `sde` agent, independent
findings to the typed `reviewer` agent, and authorization to the human release owner with existing
approval evidence naming the exact target, action, and rollback.

## When it pays — and when it doesn't

- **Parallelize** genuinely *independent* strands: research across sources, a multi-lens review,
  sweeping many files/foundations, surfacing a differential of hypotheses. Anthropic's multi-agent
  research system beat single-agent by a wide margin on parallelizable breadth — *"token usage
  explains ~80% of the variance"*. *[sourced: Anthropic multi-agent research system]*
- **Keep sequential** tightly-coupled work — especially **coding**, where each step depends on the
  last. Fan-out there causes conflicting edits and rework. *[sourced: Anthropic — multi-agent is weak
  for coding]*
- **Mind the cost.** Multi-agent fan-out can run **~15× the tokens of a normal chat** (single agents already run ~4×). Spend it only when the outcome clears that bar; **most tasks capture the reliability gains inside one agent** (sectioned tool calls, a couple of review lenses) without the multi-agent premium. *[sourced: Anthropic multi-agent research system]*

## Right-sizing

- 1 agent for a simple lookup; 2–4 for a comparison or multi-lens review; more only for genuinely complex, decomposable work. Extra agents cost coordination and tokens.
- Give each strand an **isolated context** and a **bounded mandate**, and have it return a **short
  summary**, not its transcript (see [context guidance](./context.md)).
- Combine deliberately: a merge pass reconciling the strands beats naive concatenation.
