# PCF / TAS deploy planning (cf CLI v8)

This skill produces a deployment plan and evidence checklist. **Agents never execute deployment.**
A human release owner executes only after approving the exact target, commands, blast radius,
verification, and rollback.

Before executing a prod deploy, require an evidence packet showing the release and production-change
gates were completed by their owner; if it is absent, stop and report the missing approval. This skill
does not load or run either gate. Show the manifest diff and rollback path before a human acts.

> ### ⚠️ What a rollback does NOT reverse
>
> A route swap or `cf rollback` reverses **code + start command + (revision-scoped) env vars**. It does
> **not** reverse:
> - **data and schema**—the migration the new version ran, and the rows it wrote. *A rollback after
>   an expand→contract migration's **contract** phase is not a rollback at all*—the column the old
>   code needs is gone. Sequence values are not returned either. This is the one that causes outages.
> - **service bindings**, **routes**, **scale** (instances / memory / disk quotas), **app features**—
>   none of these are captured in a revision.
> - anything a **consumer** already did with the new version's output (messages published, webhooks
>   fired, files written).
>
> Design the change so it is reversible: expand → backfill → dual-write, and do **not** contract until
> the old code is gone for good. Ownership map only—not a load: canonical `database-reliability` owns
> operational migration safety. "We can roll back" remains `[unverified]` until rehearsed evidence
> proves it for the exact artifact and target.

**Starter:** copy [manifest.yml](./assets/manifest.yml)—a health-checked, multi-instance,
service-bound manifest with stable-live-name notes.

## Manifest (declarative, in version control)

```yaml
applications:
  - name: checkout
    instances: 3
    memory: 1G
    buildpacks: [java_buildpack_offline]
    routes:
      - route: checkout.apps.example.com
    env:
      SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: prod
```

Keep secrets out of manifests; use approved service bindings or the foundation credential service.
Manifest and binding behavior on the target foundation remains `[unverified]` until captured there.

## Blue-green (classic) — preferred for prod

The live app keeps the stable name (`checkout`); green is always the disposable one. Names rotate
after the soak, so the playbook is identical on every run—there is no "blue" app, ever.

```bash
cf push checkout-green -f manifest.yml --no-route     # candidate beside live; never touches it
cf map-route checkout-green apps.example.com --hostname checkout-test
# smoke-test green on the test route
cf map-route checkout-green apps.example.com --hostname checkout    # green joins prod
cf unmap-route checkout apps.example.com --hostname checkout        # all prod traffic on green
# soak. Rollback here = re-map checkout, unmap green—the old app is still running, untouched.
cf unmap-route checkout-green apps.example.com --hostname checkout-test
cf delete checkout -f
cf rename checkout-green checkout                     # rotation: live is `checkout` again
```

Why the rotation is load-bearing: without it, the second run pushes onto the app serving production.
`--no-route` does **not** unbind routes an app already holds. *[sourced:
docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest-attributes.html]* Rollback before the rotation is
route re-mapping; after `cf delete`, rollback is a fresh push of the previous artifact.

> **[unverified] Manifest-name interaction.** The example manifest pins `name: checkout`; cf CLI v7+
> may reject or reinterpret `cf push checkout-green -f manifest.yml` when the manifest names a
> different app. This exact interaction has not been exercised on a real foundation. Before approving
> the playbook, the human release owner must either create a reviewed `manifest-green.yml` stanza/file
> naming `checkout-green`, or run the exact command on a bounded non-production foundation and attach
> its output. Until that real-foundation evidence exists, do not label the command `[verified]` and do
> not use it for production.

## Built-in strategies (lower-risk changes)

```bash
cf push checkout -f manifest.yml --strategy rolling
cf push checkout -f manifest.yml --strategy canary
cf continue-deployment checkout
cf cancel-deployment checkout
```

Support for canary and revisions varies by cf CLI/CAPI version and foundation configuration. It is
`[unverified]` for the target until the human release owner records version and non-production output.

With app revisions enabled, `cf rollback checkout --version <n>` reverts to a prior droplet + config
(revisions/rollback are GA in cf CLI v8.10.0+; older v8.x marks them experimental).

> **Revisions capture less than people assume.** A revision holds a droplet, a start command, and
> environment variables** — *not* routes, service bindings, or scale.
> - **Your real rollback window is ~5 droplets, not 100 revisions.** CF retains only the **five most
>   recent staged droplets**; you can roll back only to a revision still backed by one of them. A long
>   revision history is largely decorative. (CAPI keeps up to 100 revisions by default — the droplet
>   limit is the binding one.)
> - `cf rollback` **deploys a new revision** (the counter goes up); it does not rewind history.
> - **Cancelling ≠ rolling back.** `cf cancel-deployment` "does **not** guarantee zero downtime", and
>   **changes to environment variables and service bindings are not reverted**.

These target-specific retention and command behaviors remain `[unverified]` until the human release
owner attaches foundation/version evidence. *[sourced: Cloud Foundry application revisions and cf CLI
deployment documentation]*

## Config changes & scaling

```bash
cf set-env checkout KEY value && cf restart checkout   # runtime-only var: RESTART is enough
cf set-env checkout JBP_CONFIG_X value && cf restage checkout   # buildpack-consumed: RESTAGE required
cf scale checkout -i 5            # horizontal: more instances
cf scale checkout -m 2G -k 2G     # vertical: memory/disk (causes restart)
```

> **"Env changes require a restage" is folklore.** It depends on **who consumes the variable**:
> - **`cf restart`** is enough when only the **app** reads it at runtime (feature flags, endpoints,
>   credentials). Restart reuses the already-compiled droplet—much faster, no rebuild.
> - **`cf restage`** is genuinely required when the **buildpack** consumes it at **staging** time, because
>   staging bakes it into the droplet (`JBP_CONFIG_*`, `BP_*`, `PIP_INDEX_URL`, `NODE_ENV` for pruning…).
>
> The blanket "TIP: use `cf restage`" that `cf set-env` prints is a **conservative default**—the CLI
> can't know whether your buildpack reads the var. Restaging when a restart would do costs you a full
> rebuild on every config flip. *(Note `cf env` shows the new value immediately while the running
> container still has the old one—the value is injected at container start.)*

These are planning examples, never agent execution authority. `cf env` remains a credential-bearing,
human-only read. The human release owner selects only the approved command; the exact consumer and
target behavior remains `[unverified]` until evidenced.

## Verify every deploy

After cutover, record traffic, errors, latency, and saturation; abort on error-rate or latency
regression, missing telemetry, or failed health checks. Also record `cf app checkout`, route mappings,
the deployed artifact identity, and the human actor's result. Preserve `[verified]`, `[sourced]`, and
`[unverified]` labels through the handoff; never upgrade a claim because it crossed a gate.

## Tip

`cf push` changes the running app lifecycle. A plan without current human release-owner approval
evidence, an exact manifest diff, health criteria, and a proven rollback path is blocked.
