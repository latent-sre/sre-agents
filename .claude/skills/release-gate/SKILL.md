  Pre-release **readiness** gate — is this build ready to ship? Use as the checkpoint before
  deploying/releasing a build to an environment (especially prod): verifies recorded merge-gate PASS
  evidence, the artifact is promotable, migrations and flags are ready, monitoring is in place, and a
  tested rollback exists. Triggers: "is this build ready to ship", "run the release gate", "can we
  release this". Ownership map only—not a load: merge-gate = ready to merge; release-gate = ready to
  ship; production-change-gate = authorized to act on prod.

> **Evidence default — `[unverified]`.** Unless a paragraph carries a narrower label, each
> stack/product-specific command, query, API or CLI behavior, version, licensing statement, and
> runtime claim in this skill and its bundled files is `[unverified]` for the exact target.
> A narrower `[sourced]` or `[verified]` label takes precedence; handoffs never upgrade it.

# Release gate

A release is ready only when **all** checklist items pass. The gate is owned by a human release owner.
For production, this PASS establishes readiness only; authorization belongs to a separate, later the `production-change-gate` skill using this recorded evidence.

## Checklist

- [ ] **Merge readiness exists** — attach a recorded PASS from the `merge-gate` skill for the exact
      reviewed SHA. This skill does not load or execute that sibling gate; missing evidence is a blocking
      item.
- [ ] **Versioned & noted** — the version and changelog or release notes identify the candidate.
- [ ] **One artifact, promoted** — the exact artifact tested in lower environments is the one shipping;
      build once and promote rather than rebuilding.
- [ ] **Migrations safe** — DB, schema, and configuration migrations are backward-compatible, ordered
      before the code that needs them, and independently reversible.
- [ ] **Feature flags ready** — risky behavior is flag-gated, defaults safe, and the flag transition is
      tested.
- [ ] **Rollback written & reversible** — the human release owner records the exact rollback steps and
      evidence that they work. For PCF, the selected rollback method and target-foundation behavior remain
      `[unverified]` until foundation evidence is attached.
- [ ] **Health gates & abort criteria** — define success and failure signals before the release and state
      exactly what trips an abort.
- [ ] **Monitoring in place** — attach existing evidence from the typed `observer` agent that alerts and
      SLOs cover the new behavior and that new paging alerts have operator guidance.
- [ ] **Comms ready** — stakeholders and on-call know the window and update cadence.
- [ ] **Production boundary understood** — a prod candidate proceeds only to the separate, later the `production-change-gate` skill; this checklist neither loads that gate nor authorizes the action.

## Verdict

```text
release-gate: PASS | BLOCKED
Candidate SHA/artifact: <immutable identity>
Target: <org/space/environment>   Strategy: <blue-green|rolling|canary|flag>
Rollback: <exact steps and evidence>
Blocking items: <the NOs>
```

## Notes

- **Gate topology:** recorded merge readiness is existing evidence consumed here. Production authorization
  is separate and later, and consumes this release-readiness record for the exact candidate and target.
- Ownership map only—not a load: the `ci-actions` skill owns workflow definition. The release packet must
  attach existing artifact-provenance and protected-environment evidence rather than invoke that skill.
- A release without a clean, evidenced rollback does not pass.
