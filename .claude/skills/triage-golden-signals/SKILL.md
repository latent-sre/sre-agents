  The SIGNAL-READ STEP performed inside an `sre-ladder` triage — read the four golden signals (latency,
  traffic, errors, saturation) plus RED and USE to characterize a symptom before forming hypotheses:
  what each signal tells you and where to find it on our stack. Not a general SRE/triage skill; load it
  for the signal-reading moment only. (The `sre-ladder` tiers set depth; this is the signal read inside it.)

# Golden signals — read the system in 60 seconds

Before hypotheses, characterize the symptom with a standard signal set. Pull these from Wavefront
(`wavefront-queries`), Grafana (`grafana-dashboards`), Splunk (`splunk-triage`), and `pcf-ops`.

## The four golden signals (Google SRE)
| Signal | Question | Where (our stack) |
|---|---|---|
| **Latency** | How long do requests take? Split **success vs error** latency. | Wavefront p50/p95/p99; Grafana |
| **Traffic** | How much demand? (req/s, msgs/s) | Wavefront rate; access logs in Splunk |
| **Errors** | What rate is failing? (5xx, exceptions, wrong results) | Splunk error count; Wavefront error ratio |
| **Saturation** | How full? (CPU, memory, threads, queue depth, connections) | `cf app`; Wavefront container metrics |

## Complementary methods
- **RED** (per request-driven service): **R**ate, **E**rrors, **D**uration. Best for app endpoints.
- **USE** (per resource): **U**tilization, **S**aturation, **E**rrors. Best for memory/CPU/pools/queues.

## Ask "what changed?" first
Most incidents follow a change. Before deep hypotheses, line up **what changed** vs **when it broke**:
- recent **deploy / release** (`cf events`, the release pipeline, `git log`)
- **config or feature-flag** flip
- **PCF platform event** (cell evacuation, quota, cert rotation — `cf events`)
- **traffic shift** (spike, new client, retry/batch job)
- **dependency** incident or vendor status-page event
- **cert / credential / secret expiry** (failures starting at a round timestamp)
- **DB migration** or data change
A change whose timestamp matches the impact-start is your prime suspect → hand to `sre-ladder` (investigator tier).

## How to read them
1. **Errors + latency up together** → app or a downstream dependency is failing/slow.
2. **Saturation up, then latency, then errors** → resource exhaustion (memory/threads/pool/queue) —
   classic capacity or leak; check `cf app` instance memory and `cf events` for OOM restarts.
3. **Traffic spike → latency/errors** → load-driven; capacity or a missing limit/backpressure.
4. **Errors up, traffic flat, latency flat** → logic/deploy/config error, not load. Correlate to a change.
5. **All flat but users complain** → check from outside (ThousandEyes synthetic / health endpoint) — it
   may be network, DNS, routing, or a specific path/region.

## Pin it down
Always establish: **exact start time**, **blast radius** (which apps/routes/spaces, % of traffic), and
**trend** (worsening/stable/recovering). Hand that to `sre-ladder` (investigator tier) to drive RCA.
