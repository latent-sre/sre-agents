name: merge-gate
description: >-
  Quality gate that must pass before a code change merges. Use after code review and testing, before
  declaring a change done or merging a PR. A pass/fail checklist covering tests, review, security,
  coverage, secrets, compatibility, and docs. Invoke explicitly as Copilot `/merge-gate` or Claude
  `/merge-gate`. Triggers: "is this ready to merge", "run the merge gate", "can I merge this
  PR". Ownership map only—not a load: merge-gate = ready to merge; release-gate = ready to ship;
  production-change-gate = authorized to act on prod.

> **Evidence default — `[unverified]`.** Unless a paragraph carries a narrower label, each
> stack/product-specific command, query, API or CLI behavior, version, licensing statement, and
> runtime claim in this skill and its bundled files is `[unverified]` for the exact target.
> A narrower `[sourced]` or `[verified]` label takes precedence; handoffs never upgrade it.

# Merge gate

A change merges only when **all** of these pass. Any **NO** blocks the merge. P0/P1 findings cannot be
waived; another blocking item needs an explicit, recorded waiver from a human owner.

Throughout, **`HEAD` means the tip commit of the branch being merged — the PR head — not your local
checkout** (reviewing a PR from a local `main` would otherwise resolve `HEAD` to main's tip and block
everything).

## Checklist

- [ ] **Builds & CI green** — compile/lint/format and the full test suite pass in trusted CI. Read the
      reviewer's packet for the CI run link, execution boundary, and preserved evidence and taint labels.
      An asserted result remains `[unverified]`; missing or unverified evidence is a **NO**.
- [ ] **Behavior tested** — new or changed behavior has a regression test that fails without the fix.
      Show current CI output and **record the SHA it ran at**. If that SHA != `HEAD`, apply the same
      staleness test as below: an empty or test-irrelevant diff may be re-confirmed at `HEAD`; otherwise
      the evidence is stale and the test must re-run.
- [ ] **Reviewed** — the typed `reviewer` agent supplied its two-lens packet and every P0/P1 finding is
      resolved, not merely acknowledged. **Record the SHA the review ran against.** If that SHA != `HEAD`,
      inspect `git diff <review-sha>..HEAD`. If the diff is empty or touches only files outside the
      reviewed set, re-confirm and record the new SHA. If it touches reviewed code, **the approval is
      stale**; this item is a **NO** until re-review completes.
      The gate runner never self-classifies a non-empty diff as outside the reviewed set. A reviewer must
      inspect the complete diff and either re-review it or explicitly record why every changed path is
      irrelevant to the prior finding; newly added files are review scope.
- [ ] **Security** — when auth, input handling, secrets, crypto, file/network access, or dependencies
      changed, the reviewer's security lens is present and its P0/P1 findings are closed.
- [ ] **No secrets** — no credentials, tokens, or keys appear in code, fixtures, artifacts, or logs.
- [ ] **Backward compatible** — migrations use expand→contract where a contract changed; perform inline
      compatibility, API-contract, and UI-state checks for affected interfaces.
- [ ] **Web GUI, if touched** — keyboard and WCAG behavior is checked or explicitly waived; bundles hold
      no secrets and browser storage does not hold bearer tokens.
- [ ] **Scoped & clean** — smallest correct change; no dead code, debug leftovers, or unrelated churn.
      Size matters: ~200–400 LOC is the effective review chunk; defect detection drops past ~400 LOC and
      above ~500 LOC/hr, so cap continuous review at 60–90 min. A reviewer may request a split **solely**
      for size — an oversized change is a blocking finding, not a nit.
- [ ] **Docs/ops updated** — if behavior or operations changed, update the docs and make a typed `sre-steward`
      agent handoff for affected operational guidance, or explicitly record why none is needed.

## Verdict

### Severity rubric (what blocks)

- **P0/P1 findings** (correctness, security, data loss): block merge — no exceptions.
- **P2**: block only if the change touches the same lines; otherwise a follow-up issue, linked.
- **P3 / style**: never blocks; note it.
- An **independently-found P0/P1 count of zero** from the reviewer is itself a checklist item to
  read: an echoing gate has not been exercised — say whether that is acceptable for this change.

```text
merge-gate: PASS | BLOCKED
Reviewed SHA: <exact PR-head SHA>
Blocking items: <the NOs, each with what is needed to clear it>
Waivers (if any): <item — approved by <human> — reason>
```

## Notes

- Back this checklist with required CI and human review in branch protection.
- **The stale-approval check above is a self-run speed-bump, not the control.** The enforcement is branch
  protection's **"Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed"** — it invalidates
  approval mechanically when a later fix lands. Do not rely on the tick-box.
- "Approved with nits" may merge only when those findings are non-blocking under the rubric and tracked.
