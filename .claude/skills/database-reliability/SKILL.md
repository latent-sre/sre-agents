# Database reliability

Keep data **correct, durable, and fast**, and make schema change safe in production. Our apps run on PCF
and bind to managed relational services (Postgres / Oracle / MS SQL) — you operate at the *application +
data* layer, not the DB platform internals.

> **Safety rule (non-negotiable):** read-only inspection is fine; any **state-changing or prod-facing**
> action (running a migration, `UPDATE`/`DELETE`, killing a query, failover, scaling) needs explicit
> human confirmation and goes through a human release owner under `production-change-gate`. Show the plan
> **and** the rollback before acting.

## Migrations must be safe and reversible
- **Backward-compatible, online, no long table locks**, deployable without downtime. Every migration
  has a written **rollback path**.
- **Expand → contract** for any schema change the running code depends on:
  1. **Expand** — add the new column/table/index (nullable/with default that doesn't rewrite the table).
  2. **Backfill** — populate in batches; avoid one giant locking transaction.
  3. **Dual-write / dual-read** — new code writes/reads both old and new during the transition.
  4. **Switch** — flip reads to the new shape once backfill is verified.
  5. **Contract** — drop the old column/table in a *later* deploy, after nothing reads it.
- **Never rename or drop in a single deploy** that the currently-running code still uses.
- **Adding `NOT NULL` to an existing column** scan-locks the whole table while it validates every row.
  In Postgres, add the constraint as `CHECK (col IS NOT NULL) NOT VALID` first (cheap, takes a brief
  lock), backfill, then `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` (which scans without blocking writes) — and set the column
  `NOT NULL` once validated. Don't `ALTER COLUMN … SET NOT NULL` directly on a hot, large table.
- Assess **lock behavior and duration on production-scale data**, not a tiny dev table. Know which DDL
  is online for your engine (e.g. Postgres `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, `ADD COLUMN` without a volatile
  default; avoid blocking `ALTER`s on hot tables). Run migrations through tooling (Flyway/Liquibase/
  Alembic/`migrate`), not ad-hoc SQL.

## Performance is a feature

> ### ⚠️ "Read the plan" is not always a READ
> **`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` (Postgres) and the "actual execution plan" (MS SQL) RUN THE STATEMENT.** They are
> not observation. On a `SELECT` that means load; on an `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE`/`MERGE` it means
> **the data changes**. Postgres is explicit: *"the statement is actually executed when the ANALYZE
> option is used… other side effects of the statement will happen as usual."* This skill previously
> listed them next to plain `EXPLAIN` as if they were the same kind of act.
>
> | Engine | Safe (plan only, no execution) | EXECUTES the statement |
> |---|---|---|
> | **Postgres** | `EXPLAIN <stmt>` | `EXPLAIN ANALYZE <stmt>` |
> | **MS SQL** | Estimated plan · `SET SHOWPLAN_XML ON` | Actual plan · `SET STATISTICS XML ON` |
> | **Oracle** | `EXPLAIN PLAN FOR …` + `DBMS_XPLAN.DISPLAY` | (running the statement) |
>
> **Default to the safe column.** Reach for the executing form only on a statement you have confirmed
> is a `SELECT`, on a non-prod copy or a read replica, with DBA sign-off for prod.
>
> To get real timings on a **mutating** statement without persisting the change, Postgres documents:
> ```sql
> BEGIN;  EXPLAIN ANALYZE <the INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE>;  ROLLBACK;
> ```
> Rollback covers ordinary table DML — it does **not** undo sequence/`nextval` consumption, or effects
> that escape the transaction (FDW/dblink writes, `COPY TO PROGRAM`). Not a blanket safety net.
>
> **Oracle AWR/ADDM/ASH require the Diagnostics Pack** — a separately licensed, extra-cost Enterprise
> Edition option. The features are **installed and will happily run on an unlicensed database**, so a
> casual `@awrrpt` creates real audit exposure. Check `CONTROL_MANAGEMENT_PACK_ACCESS` (set it to
> `NONE` where unlicensed). License-free alternatives: **`EXPLAIN PLAN` / `DBMS_XPLAN`**, and
> **Statspack** (the pre-AWR facility). *Do not run AWR "just to look" — confirm licensing first.*

- Reproduce the slow query; read the plan with **plain `EXPLAIN`** (Postgres), **`EXPLAIN PLAN` +
  `DBMS_XPLAN`** (Oracle), or the **estimated** plan / `SET SHOWPLAN_XML ON` (MS SQL) — see the box
  above before reaching for the executing variants.
- **Application diagnosis vs DBA operations are different lanes.** Reading a plan and fixing a query is
  ours. Running AWR, changing DB parameters, or executing plans against prod is DBA work with their
  sign-off — hand it over rather than reaching for it.
- **Index for the real query patterns** (composite/covering indexes match `WHERE` + `ORDER BY`); avoid
  full scans on hot paths, **N+1** query patterns (a `sde-engineer`/ORM smell), and **unbounded result
  sets** — paginate.
- Verify the fix with **measured before/after numbers**, not a hunch.

## Saturation & incident triage
When a DB-driven incident hits, check the cheap saturation signals first:
- **Connections** — pool exhaustion (app waits on a free connection); right-size the pool, find leaks.
- **Locks / blocking** — long-running transactions blocking others; find the head blocker.
- **Replication lag** — stale reads / failover risk; alert on it (`slo-error-budget`, `sre-monitor`).
- **Disk / IOPS / temp** — space and I/O saturation; runaway sorts/spills.
- **Recent migrations & deploys** — correlate with "what changed" (`sre-engineer`).

Mitigate to stop pain first (kill a runaway query, add capacity, fail over) **with confirmation**, then
diagnose. Pairs with `rollback-mitigation` for the deploy-side undo.


## Durability
- Backups **exist, are monitored, and — crucially — restores are tested**. An untested backup is a hope,
  not a recovery plan.
- Know your **RPO** (data you can lose) and **RTO** (how fast you must be back). Verify replication and
  failover; don't assume them.

## Least privilege & guardrails
- Scoped DB credentials; never the admin role from the app.
- Guard against destructive statements: **no unbounded `UPDATE`/`DELETE`** (require a `WHERE` + a row-
  count sanity check); wrap risky changes in a transaction you can roll back.

## Output format
- **Migrations:** the expand/contract plan, forward **and** rollback scripts, and a lock/risk assessment
  at production scale.
- **Performance:** the query plan before/after with the measured improvement.
- Never present a destructive change without its rollback and the stated safety check.
