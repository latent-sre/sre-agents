"""PreToolUse guard — enforce read-only agents at the command level, by ALLOWLIST.

Wired in THIS repo per-agent: `sre` and `sre-steward` are project-scope agents whose frontmatter
`hooks:` invoke scripts/readonly-guard-hook.sh (probed platform fact: frontmatter hooks FIRE for
project-scope agents, and are silently ignored only for plugin-shipped ones). The guard still
scopes ITSELF on the payload's agent identity as defense in depth: a copy registered session-wide
must no-op for everything not in GUARDED_AGENTS.

Why it cannot simply live on the agent, as it used to: a plugin-shipped agent's `hooks:` frontmatter
is SILENTLY IGNORED ("For security reasons, `hooks`, `mcpServers`, and `permissionMode` are not
supported for plugin-shipped agents" — code.claude.com/docs/en/plugins-reference). Probed on CLI
2.1.200: a plugin agent's frontmatter hook never fired, while a byte-identical hook on a
project-scope agent did. Leaving `hooks:` on the agent would read as armor and provide none, so
validate_fleet.py now rejects that key outright.

Nor can the `tools:` field do this job. A scoped grant like `tools: Bash(git diff:*)` LOOKS like it
narrows Bash, and does nothing: probed on CLI 2.1.200, agents granted `Bash(git diff:*)` and
`Bash(git diff *)` both ran `git status` exactly like an agent granted a bare `Bash`. Scoped
specifiers are real, but only in settings.json permission rules — which are session-wide and would
restrict the USER's Bash too. There is no native per-agent command scoping. This hook is not a
workaround for a better mechanism; it is the only mechanism.

ALLOWLIST, NOT DENYLIST — the load-bearing design decision.

  This guard used to enumerate the state-changing verbs and deny them. That is an unbounded problem
  and it lost: `git clone`, `git submodule update`, `git lfs pull`, `npm ci`, `uv sync`,
  `gh api -f` (which POSTs) and `curl --json` all sailed through, while `rg "gh pr create" docs/` —
  a harmless search whose TEXT contained a verb — was denied. Every new tool ships new ways to
  write, so a denylist is permanently behind, and its failure mode is SILENT: an unlisted writer
  simply runs.

  So it is inverted. We enumerate what a read-only reviewer actually NEEDS — a bounded, knowable
  set — and deny everything else. Failure now means a legitimate read gets blocked: loud, obvious,
  and fixed by adding one entry. That is the right direction to fail in.

  It also means the guard no longer has to out-parse a hostile shell. Anything it cannot confidently
  understand — command substitution, redirection, a subshell, an unbalanced quote — is simply not on
  the list, and is denied.

NO CODE EXECUTION, DELIBERATELY. There is no `python`, `pytest`, `npm`, or `make` on the allowlist,
and no exemption for any script — not even this repository's own validator. Running a repo's test
suite executes that repo's code under your account; no command filter can make that read-only, and
pretending otherwise is the dishonest part. A reviewer cites the builder's test evidence or CI
instead. This also dissolves, rather than fixes, the old relative-path exemption for
`scripts/validate_fleet.py`, which a repository under review could have supplied itself.

Honest boundary — this is still NOT a sandbox. An allowlisted command with a flag combination we
did not consider may yet do something surprising, and a reviewer that can read files can read
secrets. The LOAD-BEARING control remains OS-level least privilege. What this now guarantees is far
narrower and far more defensible than before: nothing outside a short, reviewed list of readers ever
runs.

SCOPING CONTRACT (probed, not assumed): the stdin payload carries `agent_type` — namespaced for a
plugin agent (`sde-agents:code-reviewer`), bare for a project/user-scope one. THE MAIN LOOP CARRIES
NO `agent_type` KEY AT ALL, which is what makes a session-wide hook safe: the user's own Bash can
never match GUARDED_AGENTS and is never inspected. `agent_type` is UNDOCUMENTED, so if it is ever
renamed upstream the guard would silently stop guarding — see the contract canary in main().

Decision transport: a deny is the permissionDecision JSON on stdout with exit EXIT_DENY (43); an
allow is empty stdout with exit EXIT_ALLOW (42). The distinctive codes are how the hook tells THIS
guard's answer from a stand-in interpreter that merely exits 0 — see the comment at EXIT_ALLOW.
The hook shell string translates them back to the documented exit-0 contract
(https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks) before Claude Code sees anything.

Covered by scripts/test_readonly_guard.py (pure-stdlib, runs offline in CI via gate_a.py).
