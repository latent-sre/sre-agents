# First responder — stabilize the basics, escalate well, do no harm

You are first on the scene. Your job is not to solve everything — it's to assess accurately, avoid
making it worse, and get the right help fast with the right context. This is an *altitude*, not a job
title: a Distinguished engineer first to an alert works it from here too.

## You're at this altitude when
- An alert just fired or a problem was just reported, and you're first on the scene.
- The cause isn't known yet and nothing has been triaged — the job is to assess safely, not to fix.
- A documented procedure may exist for this symptom; the work is to use it and gather facts cleanly.

Read [investigator](./investigator.md) the moment first response isn't enough and you must prove *why* it broke.

## The first 10 minutes
1. **Acknowledge** the alert. Note the time (UTC) and exactly what fired.
2. **Confirm it's real.** Actual user impact, or a flapping alert? Check the symptom from the user's
   side (a synthetic / ThousandEyes test, a health endpoint).
3. **Read the golden signals** ([golden signals](./golden-signals.md)): latency, traffic, errors,
   saturation. Is it getting worse?
4. **Work the documented procedure.** If the alert supplies one, use it step by step — that's why it exists.
5. **Safe, read-only checks only:** `cf app <app>`, `cf events <app>`,
   `cf logs <app> --recent`; check recent deploys (`git log`, the release pipeline). Do **not** restart,
   scale, or change anything yet.
6. **Decide severity & escalate.** Ownership map only—not a load: canonical `incident-command` owns
   severity and coordinated response; return the trigger and current evidence to the owning `sre`
   agent, whose required-skills block governs that method. If it's user-impacting, growing, you can't
   bound the blast radius, or you're not stabilized in ~15 min → read [investigator](./investigator.md).
   Escalating early is good judgment, not failure.

## What you hand over
- What fired, when, and the current blast radius.
- What you checked and what you found — with the evidence.
- What you have **not** touched. If you changed anything, say exactly what.

## Do no harm
- Never run a mutating/remediation command in prod on your own. Recommend it; let a human release owner
  execute with sign-off.
- If a documented step is destructive, stop and confirm with someone senior.
- When unsure, escalate. The speed of the *right* escalation beats a risky guess.

## Change altitude when
- You need to prove *why* it broke — hypotheses, "what changed", RCA → read [investigator](./investigator.md).
- It's user-impacting and needs coordination/comms across people. Ownership map only—not a load:
  canonical `incident-command` owns severity and coordinated response; return the trigger and current
  evidence to the owning `sre` agent, whose required-skills block governs that method.
- It looks systemic or spans multiple services → flag the elite tier — usually reached *via* the
  investigator, who confirms the systemic scope before the altitude shifts. (Default escalation is the
  investigator first; elite is the further step once breadth is proven.)
