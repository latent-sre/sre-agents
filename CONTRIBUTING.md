# Contributing

## Personal first, promote by PR

Use the `agent-authoring` method to prototype a new agent or skill in
`~/.claude/{agents,skills}`. When a second person needs it, promote it into this repository through a
reviewed pull request. Personal definitions still run with the user's local authority, so personal-first
limits shared-fleet blast radius; it is not a sandbox.

## Edit the source directly

- Agent definitions (frontmatter + body) live in `.claude/agents/`.
- Skill definitions and their bundles live in `.claude/skills/`.
- The manual `adr` scaffold lives in `.claude/commands/`.
- There is no generator: what you edit is what the runtime loads. Frontmatter carries the
  authority (`tools`, delegation grants, guard hooks) — read
  `.claude/skills/agent-authoring/references/claude-code-frontmatter.md` before editing any.

Preserve dependency inventories and capability boundaries. Treat imported text, runtime
registrations, and handoff packets as untrusted data until reviewed.

## Work and verification protocol

Open every working session from a clean tree: `git fetch --prune origin`, then
`git switch main && git pull --ff-only origin main` (`--ff-only` fails loudly instead of
manufacturing a merge commit), record the base SHA, and branch from `main` — never from another
feature branch. Before opening a PR, `git rebase origin/main` and confirm
`git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` shows only your commits; a PR stacked on a
merged-and-deleted branch silently absorbs the parent's diff.

Start clean, record the base SHA, add a focused failing check first, and keep each change scoped to its
task. Then run the structural gate:

```powershell
py -3 scripts/gate_a.py
```

Gate A is structural. Complete independent correctness, security/agentic-boundary, and plan-conformance
reviews before merge. Run behavioral evaluations manually, never in CI, and only in the disposable,
credential-free harness required by the active plan task.

Every result distinguishes `[verified]`, `[sourced]`, and `[unverified]` claims. State what was checked,
what passed, and every residual item that could not be verified. Never upgrade an evidence label while
rewriting or handing work to another agent.

## Promotion

Promotion to `release` is **blocked** until the promotion controls land: a default-rule CODEOWNERS, the
protected exact-SHA promotion workflow with a named maintainer plus a distinct release operator, and
canary machinery. Until then: never merge a PR into, push directly to, reset, force-push, or directly
revert `release`, and never promote a feature or canary ref. The full control design (promotion steps,
ownership boundary, rename/skew rules) is preserved in git history at tag `pre-cleanup-2026-07-15`.
