"""Isolate a harness trial from the operator's machine.

Both harnesses shell out to `claude -p ...`. With no explicit `env`, that inherits the operator's
entire Claude Code install: ~/.claude/skills, ~/.claude/agents, installed plugins (which may ship
those same skills AGAIN), and the operator's global CLAUDE.md. Those do not shadow the fleet by name
-- they COMPETE with it for skill discovery, which is the one thing a discovery probe exists to
measure. Every number it ever produced described the LAPTOP, not the fleet, and every recorded
baseline says so ("treat as a LOWER BOUND").

CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR relocates the whole user config -- "If you set CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR, every ~/.claude
path on this page lives under that directory instead" (code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-directory).
Point it at a temp dir holding ONLY the credentials and the model sees the project's .claude/ and
nothing else. Probed: sde-ladder (project) YES / eng-ladder (personal) NO / backend-craft
(personal + plugin) NO.

WHY THIS MODULE REFUSES RATHER THAN DEGRADES
An EMPTY config dir breaks auth, and that failure is silent in the worst possible way: `claude -p`
still emits a VALID stream-json trace (system/init and all), exits 1, and reports "Not logged in" in
the RESULT event -- while stderr carries only an unrelated stdin warning. A harness that parses that
trace finds no Skill() call and scores a clean NO-ROUTE. Every scenario "fails", and the report reads
as a devastating finding about the fleet rather than as a broken instrument. An eval harness that
converts its own breakage into findings about the thing it measures is the worst failure available to
it. So: no credentials -> AuthUnavailable, before a single trial runs; and an auth-failure trace is an
ERROR, never a routing outcome.
